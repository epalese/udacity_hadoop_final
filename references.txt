I mostly used stackoverflow.com to find sample solutions to Python coding problems. Following a list of the main issue I solved:
- datetime Python module: https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html
- Parsing of datetimes with UTC offset needs to install the dateutil module that requires Python >= 2.7
The VM provided has installed Python 2.6
For version of Python lesser than 3.0 there are some workaround:
